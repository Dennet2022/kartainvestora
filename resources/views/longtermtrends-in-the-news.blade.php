                    person's salary. It is flashing red too: it is giving us a reading of 6.7, just below the previous high

                <h3>Seeking Alpha: Why Stagflation Is A Significant Risk</h3>

                <p><br>
                    There is a reason for great numbers from retail sales. Large-scale fiscal loosening in the U.S. has
                    caused the private
                    sector to amass significant savings (referred to as M2 money supply - cash, deposits, and savings),
                    which are being
                    unleashed in the economy through government stimulus and have grown as virus restrictions have been
                    removed and
                    confidence returns. In fact, the amount saved is more than anything we have seen in recent times and is
                    comparable to
                    the mid-'70s.
